    <h1>Privacy Policy for Spotify Pin Sync</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: May 14, 2025</p> <!-- Update with the current date -->

    <p>This application, <strong>Spotify Pin Sync</strong>, helps you convert your Spotify playlists into Pinterest boards by curating existing public pins from Pinterest.</p>

    <h2>Information We Access:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spotify:</strong> With your explicit authorization via Spotify's OAuth flow, we access your playlists and the track information within them (such as track names, artist names, album names). This information is used to understand the content and theme of your playlist to help find relevant pins on Pinterest.</li>
        <li><strong>Pinterest:</strong> With your explicit authorization via Pinterest's OAuth flow (or using a sandbox token for testing purposes), we access your list of Pinterest boards (so you can select an existing board as a destination) and have the ability to create new boards and save pins to your boards on your behalf, as per your instructions within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The information accessed is used solely to perform the core functionality of the app: converting your selected Spotify playlist into a Pinterest board by finding and saving relevant public pins from Pinterest to your chosen or newly created Pinterest board.</li>
        <li>We do not store your playlist data, track data, Pinterest board data, or personal user identifiers on our own servers. API calls to Spotify and Pinterest are made as needed to provide the app's features during your active session.</li>
        <li>Access tokens obtained from Spotify and Pinterest via OAuth are stored securely on your local device to maintain your session and avoid requiring you to log in repeatedly. These tokens are not transmitted to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing:</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personally identifiable information or the content of your playlists/boards with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent:</h2>
    <p>All actions, such as connecting your Spotify account, connecting your Pinterest account, selecting specific playlists, choosing or naming a destination Pinterest board, and initiating the pin conversion process, require your explicit consent and interaction within the application.</p>

    <h2>Security:</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information handled by our app, including the secure storage of access tokens on your device. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us:</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the app's practices, please feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository: [Link to your spopininfo GitHub repo issues page - e.g., https://github.com/your-username/spopininfo/issues].</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy:</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
